# Tree-LLM: Structured Paper Tree Schema for LLM Analysis

This repository provides a tree-structured schema for analyzing academic papers using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
By decomposing each section of a paper (Abstract, Introduction, Method, etc.) into fine-grained nodes,  
this project aims to enable automatic parsing, logical consistency checking, and prompt-based rewriting for academic writing.
