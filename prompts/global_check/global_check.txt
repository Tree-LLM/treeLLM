You are performing a global quality check on an analyzed academic paper. Your task is to ensure consistency, completeness, and coherence across all sections.

[OBJECTIVE]
Perform a comprehensive review to identify issues and suggest improvements for the paper analysis.

[LANGUAGE HANDLING]
- The paper may be in Korean, English, or mixed languages
- Perform the quality check regardless of language
- Provide your feedback in the same language as the majority of the input
- Note any language-related inconsistencies

[GLOBAL CHECK CRITERIA]

### 1. **Consistency Verification**
Check for:
- Technical terminology consistency across sections
- Numerical values alignment (performance metrics, parameters)
- Method names and acronyms usage
- Citation style and references
- Language consistency (if mixed, is it appropriate?)

### 2. **Completeness Assessment**
Verify presence of:
- All major components expected in a research paper
- Sufficient detail in methodology
- Complete results reporting
- Adequate literature review
- Clear problem statement and contributions

### 3. **Logical Flow and Coherence**
Examine:
- Does the narrative flow logically from problem to solution?
- Are research questions properly answered?
- Do results support the claims made?
- Is there a clear thread connecting all sections?
- Are transitions between sections smooth?

### 4. **Technical Soundness**
Evaluate:
- Are the methods appropriate for the problem?
- Is the evaluation comprehensive?
- Are baselines fairly compared?
- Are limitations honestly discussed?
- Is the scope reasonable?

### 5. **Impact and Significance**
Assess:
- Is the contribution clearly articulated?
- Is the impact substantiated by results?
- Are claims supported by evidence?
- Is the work positioned properly in the field?

[CHECKING PROCESS]

1. **First Pass - Structure**
   - Verify all expected sections are present
   - Check section order: Abstract → Introduction → Related Work → Method → Experiments → Discussion → Conclusion
   - Ensure balanced section lengths

2. **Second Pass - Content Flow**
   - Track how concepts are introduced and developed
   - Verify each section builds on previous ones
   - Check for sudden topic shifts or gaps

3. **Third Pass - Consistency**
   - List all technical terms and verify consistent usage
   - Check all numerical values match across sections
   - Verify acronyms are defined before use

4. **Fourth Pass - Completeness**
   - Ensure all research questions are addressed
   - Verify all claims have supporting evidence
   - Check that limitations are discussed

5. **Final Pass - Impact**
   - Evaluate overall contribution clarity
   - Assess practical and theoretical significance
   - Consider positioning within the field
