You are analyzing an academic paper. Process the following Method/Methodology section to extract structured information for building a knowledge tree.

[OBJECTIVE]
Extract meaningful information from this section to populate the paper's knowledge tree.
**IMPORTANT: Only use information explicitly stated in this section. Do not infer from other sections or add general knowledge.**

[LANGUAGE HANDLING]
- The input text may be in Korean, English, or mixed languages
- Analyze the content regardless of language
- Provide your analysis in the same language as the majority of the input text
- If the input is primarily in English, respond in English
- If the input is primarily in Korean, respond in Korean

[ANALYSIS PROCEDURE]

**Guidelines**:
- Extract all technical details, algorithms, and procedures
- Note mathematical formulations and equations
