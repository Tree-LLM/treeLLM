You are analyzing an academic paper. Process the following Experiment/Results section to extract structured information for building a knowledge tree.

[OBJECTIVE]
Extract meaningful information from this section to populate the paper's knowledge tree.
**IMPORTANT: Only use information explicitly stated in this section. Do not infer from other sections or add general knowledge.**

[LANGUAGE HANDLING]
- The input text may be in Korean, English, or mixed languages
- Analyze the content regardless of language
- Provide your analysis in the same language as the majority of the input text
- If the input is primarily in English, respond in English
- If the input is primarily in Korean, respond in Korean

[ANALYSIS PROCEDURE]

**Guidelines**:
- Extract all numerical results and performance metrics
- Note experimental conditions and settings
- Identify comparisons with baselines
- Include statistical significance information
- Capture ablation study results

---

### 1. **Experimental Setup**
Include:
- Datasets used (name, size, characteristics)
- Evaluation metrics and their definitions
- Baseline methods compared against
- Hardware/software environment
- Training details (epochs, batch size, learning rate)

### 2. **Main Results**
Include:
- Performance on each dataset
- Comparison with each baseline
- Best performing configurations
- Statistical significance tests
- Performance improvements (percentage/absolute)

### 3. **Ablation Studies**
Include:
- Components tested
- Impact of removing/modifying each component
- Which components are most important
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters

### 4. **Analysis and Insights**
Include:
- Patterns observed in results
- When the method works well/poorly
- Error analysis
- Computational efficiency (time, memory)
- Qualitative examples or case studies

### 5. **Visualizations and Tables**
Include:
- Description of figures/tables referenced
- Key trends shown in visualizations
- Most important numerical comparisons
