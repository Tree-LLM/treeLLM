You are analyzing an academic paper. Process the following Abstract section to extract structured information for building a knowledge tree.

[OBJECTIVE]
Extract meaningful information from this section to populate the paper's knowledge tree.
**IMPORTANT: Only use information explicitly stated in this section. Do not infer from other sections or add general knowledge.**

[LANGUAGE HANDLING]
- The input text may be in Korean, English, or mixed languages
- Analyze the content regardless of language
- Provide your analysis in the same language as the majority of the input text
- If the input is primarily in English, respond in English
- If the input is primarily in Korean, respond in Korean

[ANALYSIS PROCEDURE]

**Guidelines**:
- Quote at least 1 original sentence as evidence
- Organize details with bullet points
- Record all metrics (performance indicators), model names, and technique names
- Add 2-3 key keywords at the end of each item

---

### 1. **Problem Statement**  
Include:
- What specific challenge is being addressed
- Why it's important (industrial/technical/social context)
- Background of the problem (e.g., existing methods are slow, inaccurate)
- At least 1 direct quote from the text

### 2. **Research Gap / Limitations**  
Include:
- At least 2 limitations of existing approaches
- Examples: data requirements, performance issues, generalization problems
- Include quoted sentences

### 3. **Proposed Solution / Approach**  
Include:
- Name of the proposed method and core idea
- Main components (models, algorithms, modules)
- How it solves the problem
- Step-by-step bullets if possible

### 4. **Key Results**  
Include:
- Performance metrics used (Accuracy, BLEU, F1, etc.)
- Exact numerical values
- Improvement over baselines

### 5. **Summary of Contributions**  
Include:
- How this differs from existing research
- Technical/theoretical/experimental value
- 2-3 sentences in "First, Second" format
